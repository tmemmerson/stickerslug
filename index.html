        <h2>Stickerslug AFK</h2>
        <p>
          With sincerest apologies, we are temporarily suspending our online
          store operations. No different that anyone else's experience in 2020,
          we have endured our own difficulties, both as a business and as the
          individuals who manage day-to-day operations. It is because of these
          tribulations that we must, at the least, temporarily suspend many
          operations. You can still find some of our products on your favorite
          second hand marketplaces. Thank you for your understanding, and we
          hope that you and yours are fairing well in these times. All the best
          :-)
